# Aircraft separation

## General Separation

While in flight if there is not a more specific rule which applies
then aircraft must be separated by at least 3nm laterally or 1000 feet
vertically.  No separation incidents are registered for aircraft in
their first minute of flight.

A notice will occur for aircraft which do not have sufficient vertical
separation and are within 4nm laterally.

Collisions occur when an aircraft is within approximately 160 feet of
another aircraft.

## Diverging courses

Aircraft may approach closer if they are on courses which differ by at
least 15 degrees and one aircraft has passed the point where the
courses intersect.  If the headings differ by more than 165 degrees,
then the aircraft may approach closer once the distance between them
is increasing.

## Head-on use of runway

A warning will be issued if two aircraft within 6 miles of each other
are assigned to the same runway but have opposite headings.

## Reduced lateral separation during runway approach

Standard vertical separation may be applied if the specified lateral
separation isn't maintained.

Aircraft are considered established when they are laterally within 160
feet of the approach centerline.

### Same runway

Two aircraft which have both captured the same runway localizer must remain
at least 2.5nm from each other.  A notice occurs at 2.8nm.

### Different runways

The separation distance between two aircraft may be set on a runway by
runway basis.  Typically two aircraft may approach no closer than
4,300 to 3,000 feet laterally while both are established on the
approach.  In some cases the minimum separation may be higher such as
a simultaneous close parallel approach where it will be 9114 feet (1.5
nautical miles).
